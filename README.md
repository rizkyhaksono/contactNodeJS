# Contact Node JS

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Contact Node JS in action.**

This is a minimal CRUD application based on the [CRUD NODEJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSLJx5t4OJ4&list=PLFIM0718LjIW-XBdVOerYgKegBtD6rSfD) within the NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB documentation.

A basic CRUD with add, edit delete and view function web application.

- `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/(your database)` - Points to the mongoDB main database file and lists its details. (only local databases)
- `App.js` - Starts the app with node app or use nodemon in your CLI

You can learn more about each of these components within the [NODEJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
